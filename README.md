### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Youdooo
#### A simple todo-list app with flask. Tried neumorphism. Still learning...
I made this project just for fun this project allows you to create simple todo list for your daily routine on web.

Skills: PYTHON / HTML / CSS

## Requirements
- Python 3 or greater
- python-flask
- python-sqlalchemy

Possibly missing python packages will be installed during the installation process.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amo95/youdooo.git
cd youdooo
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

python3 app.py OR in terminal type:
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

Alternatively, you can download a desired version from the [Release page](https://github.com/bitbrute/evillimiter/releases).<br>

## Usage

Type ```evillimiter``` or ```python3 bin/evillimiter``` to run the tool.

```evillimiter``` will try to resolve required information (network interface, netmask, gateway address, ...) on its own, automatically.
